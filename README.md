Identifying healthcare provider candidates for Support during COVID-19 pandemic.

## Introduction

COVID-19 is affecting minority communities at disproportionate levels in Colorado. The specific drivers of this inequity in the healthcare system are not the target of this analysis but are investigated by groups such as [The Office of Health Equity in the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment](https://colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/ohe) and [The Colorado Health Foundation](https://www.coloradohealth.org/how-we-work/how-we-are-working-achieve-health-equity).
The goal of this project is to identify healthcare providers established in communities that are composed primarily of minority populations that may face health inequities. These providers are especially important during this crisis as they are embedded in communities and serve as subject matter experts in meaningful, community-centric interventions to reduce the spread of disease. We suspect they would also benefit from direct support through corporate and individual giving as well as governmental resource allocation.
